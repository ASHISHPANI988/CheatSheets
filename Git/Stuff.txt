#Wanna merge many commits into one
To squash four commits into one, do the following:

$ git rebase -i HEAD~4

#Important: If you've already pushed commits to GitHub, and then squash them locally, 
you will have to force the push to your branch.

$ git push origin branch-name --force
Helpful hint: You can always edit your last commit message, before pushing, by using:

$ git commit --amend
