FOR FIRST TIME:
===============
git config --global user.email "ktrivedi@cisco.com"
git config --global user.name "Ketul Trivedi"


clone repository to local (this can done using SSH or HTTPS)
git clone https://gitlab-sjc.cisco.com/FANaas/fanaas-deployment.git

go to root directory
   cd fanaas-deployment/


just for validation 
   git branch   # This will show that you have cloned master branch


if you want to see configuration of git, go to .git directory and open file 'config'


make necessary changes to the code


validate using 'git status' and see changes that you have just made

create a branch in your local machine
   git checkout -b ktrivedi_dev

Add changes to git local ktrivedi_dev repository
   git add cdvr_tools


validate using 'git status' and see changes that you have just made

make object locally with your changes
   git commit -m "added CSR (not yet configured), FND and FND configuration"


push changes to cloud git repository
   git push --set-upstream origin ktrivedi_dev



NEXT TIME
=========
make necessary changes to the code

validate using 'git status' and see changes that you have just made.
It will list the files you created or modified.
   1. validate all the code that has changed
   2. validate the branch it is pointing to

if the branch you are pointing is not correct, then use git checkout -b <Branch_Name>
validate using git branch, if you need to

go to directory that is parent of all changes

add changes to local repository
   git add .

if you want to add only specific file, use following
   git add <file_name>

make object locally with your changes 
   git commit -m "some cosmetic changes"

push changes to cloud git repository
   git push 
notice that subsequent time, we do do not have to use "--set-upstream origin ktrivedi_dev"


BRANCH WITH NO COMMON PARENT 
Not HAVING ANY EXISTING files
=============================
git checkout --orphan branchname
git rm -rf .
After doing that you can create, add, and commit new files and the resulting branch will have no common history with any other branches in your project (unless you merge them at some point)


FIX FILE SIZE PROBLEM
=============================
git config http.postBuffer 524288000


MERGE MANY COMMITS INTO one
=============================
To squash four commits into one, do the following:
$ git rebase -i HEAD~4

#Important: If you've already pushed commits to GitHub, and then squash them locally, 
you will have to force the push to your branch.

$ git push origin branch-name --force
Helpful hint: You can always edit your last commit message, before pushing, by using:
$ git commit --amend
